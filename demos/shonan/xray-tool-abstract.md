# Lively4 XRay: live exploration of  structure and behavior of HTML elements

<!-- Context: What is the broad context of the work? What is the importance of the general research area? -->
**Context:** 
- HTML elements are nested in deep composition hierarchies

<!-- Inquiry: What problem or question does the paper address? How has this problem or question been addressed by others (if at all)? -->
**Inquiry:**
- gab between displayed elements and element structure is often to wide and can only be explored for individual elements

<!-- Approach: What was done that unveiled new knowledge? -->
**Approach:** 
- make underlying element composition visible in the UI 

<!-- Knowledge: What new facts were uncovered? If the research was not results oriented, what new capabilities are enabled by the work? -->
**Knowledge:**

- structure is interesting but slicing is needed, because total structure information is overwhelming

<!-- Grounding: What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts, or results and evaluation support this work? -->
**Grounding:**

- build prototype

<!-- Importance: Why does this work matter? -->
**Importance:** 

- can be applied to all HTML content
