# Lively4 -- Vision of Explorative Web-Programming

<!-- Context: What is the broad context of the work? What is the importance of the general research area? -->
**Context:** 
- Exploratory Tools apply their magic to content residing inside a (self-supporting) environments. E.g. special frameworks or languages are required.

<!-- Inquiry: What problem or question does the paper address? How has this problem or question been addressed by others (if at all)? -->
**Inquiry:**
- outside world cannot make use of cool inside tools
- inside tools cannot work with outside resources without loosing magic
- web: effortless collaborative development (wiki vs. git workflow)

<!-- Approach: What was done that unveiled new knowledge? -->
**Approach:** 
- Outside world material: HTML/JavaScript
  - HTML used to be a only a generation target UI for frameworks other systems
  - make: HTML/JavaScript the system to express domain/solution in
- Building collaborative, self-supporting development environment **of** *outside world material* that can work with outside world material
- Exploratory programming system **for** *outside world material*

<!-- Knowledge: What new facts were uncovered? If the research was not results oriented, what new capabilities are enabled by the work? -->
**Knowledge:**
- pushing boundaries of exploratory programming environments
- pure object graph vs. documents, names, explicit references

<!-- Grounding: What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts, or results and evaluation support this work? -->
**Grounding:**
- we build Lively4 environment
- developed, used and evolved tools and workflows from within it

<!-- Importance: Why does this work matter? -->
**Importance:** since, outside world is huge, 
- exploratory workflows can enrich HTML/JavaScript development experience 
- tools and environment can be easier to create if external contributions are easier to integrate / use
