# Are there conventions?

## Source Code

- We use 2 spaces instead of tabs for indention

## File Names

Currently, there is still a mix and multiple schemes when it comes to naming files and directories. But there are concetions

- "my file.html": don't use spaces in filenames, just don't!
- "my-dir" or my-file.html": when name our html templates and JavaScript files like this and use "-" in composita
- "some_other_file.html": use "_" instead of space
- "MyDir": don't use CamelCasein file names, it is still used in names of some directories under [/doc](.)

There are exceptions, especially when we don't have control over filenames and source code in [/srv/external](../../src/external/).
