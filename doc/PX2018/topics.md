# Abstract

Active Essays and Explorable Explanations is a form of interactive media that can help understand complex systems for many relevant domains.
In particular, the domain of software design is filled with challenging algorithms, patterns, and systems that are hard to understand and master.Â 
In this seminar, the participants will create demos, tools, and applications based on the idea of Explorable Explanations to improve the programming experience when developing such systems.
By using our live collaborative development environment, Lively4, they will share, explore, and adapt the created tools and explanations --- even in unanticipated ways.

# Topics


<script>
// Poor men's: Table of Content / Topic list... I always wanted to do this in PowerPoint... but I did not know how to use Macros...
(async () => {
  var container = lively.query(this, "lively-container")
  var source = await fetch(container.getURL()).then(r => r.text())
  var topics = source.split("\n").filter(ea => ea.match(/^## Topic/)).map(ea => <li>{ea.replace(/## Topic\: /,"")}</li>)

  // #Idea, instead of just printing a TOC in the view, we could materialize them as content and update the topic number? 
  // #Contra, maybe this should be very static and done by hand to use them as references....
  var ul = <ul>{...topics}</ul>
  return ul
