## Motivation and historical background
<img src='assets/img/ideas.jpg' width='300' />
<p>For many applications in our world it is important to keep track of certain events and their occurrence date. One very basic example which apply to nearly everyone is our birth. Usually, the birth of a person is certified by issuing a birth certificate. Such a birth certificate always states the date of the event - better known as our birth date. Such recording of an event and its date is named timestamping.

In former research communities timestamping was a serious issue. How possibly could a researcher proof that she had a disruptive idea, found a new concept to solve a problem or invented something at a specific point of time? Most of the time this question became relevant in the context of taking out a patent for an idea.

People developed several different approaches to tackle the timestamping problem: Some kept a complete log about there activities, ideas and their development. Others copied their research results and sent them as a letter to themselves. The date stamp on the letter served as a trusted timestamp. Nevertheless, all of these approaches had different issues: They were either not forgery-proofed, expensive or simply hard to apply. As a consequence, the research community continued to find better solutions for the timestamping problem.
