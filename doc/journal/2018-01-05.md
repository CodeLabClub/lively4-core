CKEditor looks a promsing WYSIWYG Editor for HTML, but it lacks fontSize support... Which was the only reason I was looking for an alternative to ``document.execCommand``.

```
lively.loadJavaScriptThroughDOM("CKE", "https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/1.0.0-alpha.2/balloon/ckeditor.js")

BalloonEditor.create(that)
```
