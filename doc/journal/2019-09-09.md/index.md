# #Navbar

## Issues

- global functions not in #Details
- classes are not sorted in order
- distplay getters and setters

## Ideas

- replace/enrich files column with index.md structure and tags
- alternative: store meta data per directory so files can have tags and categories 
- make filtering persistent across navigation (@Stefan)
- allow sorting/tagging/adding comments etc from the details view
- working with multi-selection and drag and drop in details view
- this would approach projectional editing from yet another direction
