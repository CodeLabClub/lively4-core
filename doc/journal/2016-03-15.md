## 2016-03-15  "Taking it to Th'emacs"

I was rereading a post[ "Taking it to Th'emacs"](http://gbracha.blogspot.de/2014/08/taking-it-to-themacs.html) of Gilad Bracha again when I rediscovered a very related project: [Leisure](http://zot.github.io/Leisure/?load=elisp/README.org) was mentioned side  by side of Lively Kernel in this post. And the current UI experience makes it very similar to what I we are aiming in Lively4 and our lively-container. Luckily, the project seems to heavily rely on a running Emacs and its org mode... but we will see. Definitly, some very related work! #RelatedWork #Lively4 #LiterateProgramming #ActiveEssays #DynamicMedia
