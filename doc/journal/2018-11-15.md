## 2018-11-15 #LivelyDown 


Sadly, our lively-kernel.org server is down and we cannot work on our #Lively4 instances at the moment, because it served as reverse proxy....

And that means we cannot authenticate ourselves to #GitHub at the moment.... 

But luckily we are still authenticated in one browser on can transfer the tokens. But first we have to get them. 

```javascript

async function createGithubTokenSnippet(keys) {
  var result = ""
  var prefix = "LivelySync_"
  for(var key of keys) {
    var itemName = prefix + key
    var value = await focalStorage.getItem(itemName)
    result += `focalStorage.setItem("${itemName}","${value}")\n`
  }
  return result
}
createGithubTokenSnippet(["githubToken", "githubUsername", "githubEmail"])


```

And we cet something we can execute.... 
```javascript
focalStorage.setItem("LivelySync_githubToken","ad947xxxxxx")
focalStorage.setItem("LivelySync_githubUsername","JensLincke")
focalStorage.setItem("LivelySync_githubEmail","jens.lincke@hpi.uni-potsdam.de")
```
