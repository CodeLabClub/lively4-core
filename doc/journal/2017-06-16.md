### PDF.js improvements

After replacing our custom viewer pdf.js code with their default viewer code, 
our pdfs look sharp again. Further we have also support for text selection, and we can render 
as optionally render as SVG. Annotations are displayed correctly, and I even found a wonderful
project that shows how to interactively annotate the documents.

## Cut, Copy, and Paste is back!

We paste text, html and images... and copy everything as html:

<div class="lively-content" style="width: 200px; height: 100px; border: 1px solid black;  background-color: rgba(40, 40, 80, 0.5);"></div>
