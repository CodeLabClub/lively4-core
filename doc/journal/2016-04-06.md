## 2016-04-06 #LivelySync

The approaching seminar makes it necessary to also support multiple users in our node.js server and 
I replaced the auto commit that always used my credentials with a special control method in our server that triggers a sync with github. That request can be customized with username and github token that we get from via oauth anyway...

Now we have to build some UI and integrate it into our workflow... 

```JS
fetch("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/_git/sync", {
    headers: new Headers({ 
    	"gitusername" : "jens.lincke",
    	"gitpassword" : "f777a0fa178bc855c28f89b402786b3....."
    })
  }).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log)
```
We can also provide a commit messages so that it will not use the default....
