Here we go... we are there... nearly. At least we the core tools working again. 

### What is missing?


- [x] Edit templates and modules affect components
- [x] lively-hand
- [x] lively-notifications
- [ ] `::slotted(*)  li` does not work, see [treeview](browse://src/components/draft/lively-treeview.html)
- [ ] lively-key-value-map.html used links....
- [ ] refactor lively-debugger to use code mirror
