## 2018-02-08 Experimenting with dragging to desktop

Ah... I forgot that @Stefan already tried it out and came the conclusion, that
it works as long as it comes from the server... any other means to produces "virtual" files seem to fail. I guess it has something to do with security? 

```javascript
// #Problem blocked... it seems that the drop code is picky in what it accepts
let url = "data:,Hello%2C%20World!",
  name = "element.txt",
  mimetype = "text/plain";

//  evt.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", "This is text to drag")
evt.dataTransfer.setData("DownloadURL", `${mimetype}:${name}:${url}`);    
```

```javascript
// #Problem results in network error, it seems that the url is not loaded
// in the scope of the page
let url = "https://lively4/sys/mounts",
    name = "mounts",
    mimetype = "text/plain"
evt.dataTransfer.setData("DownloadURL", `${mimetype}:${name}:${url}`);    
```
