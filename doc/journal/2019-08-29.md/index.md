- Context: Self-supporting Collaborative Development Environment
- Problem: 
	- Programmers are users too: they should have the ability to adapt their tools and creating new ones (while using them)
	- Developers can collaboratively evolve their working environment and adapt their tools to the problem at hand
- Solution: Use dynamic capabilities and collaborative JavaScript and Web
- Impact: specific tools can be adapted faster and evolved in the context of them motivating problem
- Example: X-Ray (+ JSX)
	- Example Context: UI development (of applications and tools (self-supporting))
	- Example Problem: Mapping between Abstract Source code and the concrete UI elements is hard (bidirectional even harder)
	- Example Solution: Seeing the UI through special glasses (similar to a HUD) that augment the concrete element with labels, colors and lines. 
	- Example Impact: This reveals the underlying structure, highlights events and behavior, and enables navigation to abstract source code
