      <p>SqueakJS is a Virtual Machine
      for the Squeak dialect of Smalltalk, written in pure JavaScript by Bert Freudenberg.
      Above is a stripped-down version of Squeak 2.2, which was released in 1998.
      Modern Squeak versions are much more advanced, but more demanding, too. You can try
      them on the SqueakJS <a href="../run">launcher page</a>.
      Also, you may want to try the <a href= "http://lively-web.org/users/bert/squeak.html">Lively SqueakJS Debugger</a>.
